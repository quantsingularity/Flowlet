## Overview

Flowlet simplifies embedded finance by exposing payments, wallets, card issuance, and compliance through a single unified API. It is cloud-native and microservices-based, emphasizing scalability, security, and regulatory readiness while reducing operational overhead. Developer SDKs, documentation, and built-in AI for fraud detection and observability accelerate integration so teams can deliver auditable finance features without rebuilding core banking primitives.

## Key Features

Flowlet's strength lies in its comprehensive suite of embedded finance capabilities, meticulously implemented across its microservices architecture.

## Installation & Setup

Flowlet supports two primary deployment environments: **Development** (local setup) and **Production** (Kubernetes/Helm).

### Prerequisites

| **Node.js**       | 20+                                                       |
| **pnpm**          | Package manager for frontend dependencies.                |
| **Docker**        | Docker Engine and Docker Compose (for development setup). |
| **Kubectl, Helm** | Required for production setup.                            |

### Quick Start (Development)

The `setup.sh` script is the primary tool for environment configuration. Use the `--env development` flag for a local setup.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quantsingularity/Flowlet.git
cd Flowlet

# Run the setup script for the development environment
./scripts/setup.sh --env development

# To start all services (backend and frontend)
./dev-start.sh
```

### Production Deployment (Kubernetes)

For production, Flowlet is designed to be deployed using Helm charts to a Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
# Run the setup script for the production environment
# This will check for kubectl/helm, create secrets, and deploy via Helm
./scripts/setup.sh --env production --namespace flowlet-prod

# To check the status of the deployment
kubectl get pods -n flowlet-prod
```
